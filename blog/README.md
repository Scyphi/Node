This is a simple blog node/express app that allows users to post and view blog articles.

Currently, the remove blog post, comment on blog posts, and other such functionality are mapped in server.js but are not implemented. There are no plans to complete such functionality.

Run `npm install` to get required node.js modules before running the server.

To use: Type `node server` in the command line and then visit ***localhost:8080\posts*** to view any posts or ***localhost:8080\posts\new*** to add posts to the server.

Posts are not stored in a database and will be erased when the server is shut down.
